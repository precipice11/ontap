    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
        Founded by Rayan Master, OnTap was developed to solve a growing problem in urban areas â€” the difficulty of locating safe 
        and convenient water sources. Recognizing the environmental impact of single-use plastic bottles and the need for accessible water, 
        OnTap was created to connect people to nearby drinking fountains and refill stations through an intuitive and user-friendly platform.
